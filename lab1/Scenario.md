The development team has created a new website for a small company, which should be launched in production within two months. They are faced with the problem that every time they release new code to the QA environment, it leads to poor website performance. They also found that a lot of time is spent on manual testing and deployment.
Applying DevOps practices:
1. Continuous Integration and Deployment: The team can use continuous integration and deployment tools such as Jenkins or GitLab CI to automatically create, test and deploy code changes in a shorter time. For example, Jenkins can be configured to run an automatic build and deployment every time the code gets into a certain branch of the repository.

2. Automation: The team can automate the processes of building, testing and deploying a website, which will allow faster identification and correction of errors and accelerate the release of new features. For example, automatic build, testing and deployment tools such as Travis CI or Puppet can be used.

3. Collaborative Culture: Team members can interact with each other regularly to quickly fix problems and reduce the time spent on testing and deployment. A distributed team can use various tools for communication and collaboration, such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom.
