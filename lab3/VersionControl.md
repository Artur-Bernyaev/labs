1. Version Control Systems (VCS): Version Control Systems are software tools that help manage and track changes made to files and code over time. They enable teams to work collaboratively on projects by providing a structured and organized way to keep track of modifications, manage different versions of files, and facilitate seamless collaboration among team members.
2. Benefits of Using Version Control in a Collaborative Environment: 
    a)  History and Auditing: Version control systems maintain a complete history of all changes made to files, including who made the changes and when.
    b)  Collaboration: VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously.
    c)  Branching and Merging: VCS allows for the creation of branches, which are independent lines of development. 
    d)  Code Review: VCS systems often provide tools for code review, allowing team members to review changes, leave comments, suggest improvements, and ensure code quality.
3. Types of Version Control Systems:
    a)  Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS): In a CVCS, a central server stores the entire history of the codebase, and developers check out individual files or branches to make changes.
    b)  Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): In DVCS, each developer has a local copy of the entire repository, including the complete history.
4. Comparison of Popular Version Control Systems:
    a) Git: Git is a widely adopted DVCS known for its speed, scalability, and flexibility. Git excels in branching and merging, distributed collaboration, and has an extensive ecosystem of tools and services supporting its use.
    b) Subversion (SVN): SVN is a centralized version control system that is relatively easy to learn and use. It provides strong versioning capabilities, but branching and merging can be more complex compared to Git.
    c) Mercurial: Mercurial is another DVCS with similarities to Git. It emphasizes ease of use and simplicity while offering powerful features such as efficient branching and merging.
